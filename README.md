# Caser-tensorflow
A TensorFlow Implementation of Convolutional Sequence Embedding Recommendation Model (Caser)

*Personalized Top-N Sequential Recommendation via Convolutional Sequence Embedding, Jiaxi Tang and Ke Wang , WSDM '18*

This repo is implementation of Caser. Codes are based on [graytowne/caser-pytorch](https://github.com/graytowne/caser_pytorch) which is organized by an author of paper and I transferred them to tensorflow.

## Requirements
I developed codes under the environment as below.
- Python 2.7x
- Tensorflow v1.11
- Numpy

## Usage
1. Install required packages
2. run <code>python train_caser.py</code>

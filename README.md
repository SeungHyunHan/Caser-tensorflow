*Personalized Top-N Sequential Recommendation via Convolutional Sequence Embedding, Jiaxi Tang and Ke Wang , WSDM '18*

This repo is implementation of Caser. Most of these codes are based on [caser-pytorch](https://github.com/graytowne/caser_pytorch) from the author and I transferred it to tensorflow version.

## Requirements

- Python 2
- Tensorflow v1.11
- Numpy

## Usage
1. Install required packages
2. run python train_caser.py
